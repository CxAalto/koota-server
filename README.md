About
=====

Koota is a project which collects data from various devices, such as
phones.  It stores the data and provides personal, and optionally
research access, in privacy-preserving ways.

This is under active development, and this repository should be
considered a development repo.  Currently, this source code is
synonymous with the master instance and further deployments would
require splitting work.
