About
=====

Koota is a research data collection system.  Data is collected from
various devices, mostly from human subjects.  There are three main use
cases: Individuals actively collecting their own data, research
studies involving researchers learning from many subjects, and finally
a hybrid: individuals collect their own data, and donate it to
research groups as they see fit, after it has been collected.

This project is under active development, and this repository should
be considered a development repo.  Currently, this source code is
synonymous with the master instance.  Future deployments will require
some splitting of certain components.

This project is developed in the Complex Systems Group, CS Department,
Aalto University, Finland.
