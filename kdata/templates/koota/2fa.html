<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">Two-factor
    auntentication</a> is a security method where you need more than
    just a password to log in.  Koota does this with the "time-based
    one time password algorithm".  You have an app on your phone
    which will generate one-time codes which you have to use to log
    in.  In Koota, some groups require this for higher security and
    you can't access any data without it.</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the Google Authenticator app.</li>
  <li>Link it to the following QR code.</li>
  <li>Test the code once on this page (required).</li>
  <li>Use the app to give the six-digit code when logging in.</li>
</ol>


{# Confirmed codes #}
{% if confirmed %}
<p>Your 2FA device is confirmed.  If have logged in using two-factor
authentication, and successfully re-verify your code, you can view the
QR code again so that you can re-use it.</p>
