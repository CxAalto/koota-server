"""Upload data to koota.

This is a stand-alone command line program which can upload data to
the Koota server.  It should have no dependencies besides straight
Python.

Usage:
    $ python upload.py device_id data_file

Data packets should be split into smaller chuckns (ideally ~100 kb),
and then uploaded separately.  This script should be modified to do
that, and then upload each chuck in sequence.  Be careful to consider
the case of errors, so that each chuck will be uploaded once but no
more than once.

TODO: verify SSL certificates and use the pinned endpoint.  (two
complexities: may need another dependency, may need actual other files
on disk thus making this not a single file.)
